        <p>
          Before instant cameras, pictures were taken on a roll of film,
          sent to a lab, and then they would be ready for retrieval after
          development. This process would take around seven days. Instant
          cameras gave the ability to print photos right after taking a
          picture. Although its popularity was unstable in some parts of
          history, it continues to thrive in the modern world with more
          modern instant cameras being sold in retail stores today.
          Instant cameras have become a new way of taking pictures while
          bringing a different aesthetic and medium. Newer instant
          cameras have been developed to fit the modern day, but still
          bring a certain nostalgia through film prints.

        <h2>The Real Father of the Instant Camera</h2>
    </header>

        <p>
          Samuel Shlafrock was the first inventor of the instant camera.
          Invented in 1932, his invention consisted of a camera and a
          portable wet darkroom in a single compartment (Baggs, 2021).
          Unfortunately, it never gained traction due to the inconvenience
          and cost (Timetoast, 1923). He died from cancer in April 1959 in
          New York (Geni, 2022).

        <h2>The Second Father of the Instant Camera</h2>
    </header>

        <p>
            The innovator who was mainly credited for the creation of instant
            cameras was Edwin Herbert Land. Land was an American scientist,
            inventor, and physicist who perfected instant photography. When Land
            was a student at Harvard University, he had a fascination for
            polarized light, which is light waves aligned in the same plane and
            in only one direction (Britannica, 1998). His studies and research led him
            to found Polaroid Corporation and made business from polarizing films.
            The Polaroid Corporation contributed many of its projects to World War
            II. One of the projects they contributed was cameras with polarizing
            lenses. After World War II, Polaroid gained more employees and research
            expertise, but no plan for the future.

            In 1943 during a vacation in Santa Fe, New Mexico, Land took a photo of
            his three-year-old daughter, Jennifer. His daughter asked him why she
            couldn't see the photo right away, which led him to ponder on the idea
            for a few years before he was able to understand how he could create
            instant photographs.
        </p>
            
        <p>
            His first public demonstration of instant photography was on February
            21, 1947. The first Polaroid camera was called the Model 95 (or Land
            camera), and its film went on sale in 1948 at a department store in
            Boston. It sold out in minutes (American Chemical Society, n.d.).
            Land's invention is described to be an intersection of science and art.
            His research and industrial process for his invention were "dedicated to
            the discernment of deep human needs" (Shady Hill Studios, n.d.). His
            research and technological achievements were greatly admired by
            scientists and chemists.

        <h2>Land's System</h2>
    </header>

        <p>
            Land's system was similar to Shlafrock's in that the cameras' systems
            would compress all of the components of a typical darkroom into a
            single film unit. The key to his system was a film unit that contained
            both the negative film and a positive receiving sheet joined by a
            reservoir that had a small amount of chemical reagents that started
            and stopped film development. A pair of rollers at the mouth of the
            camera bit the reservoir, rupturing it and allowing the reagent to be
            forced evenly across the film, which would coat the entire image. The
            reagent would spread, and the various chemicals would remove the
            unexposed silver halide from the negative, release it onto the positive
            layer at the top of the film unit, and reduce it, which then produces
            the final image. Some earlier films required extra steps like swabbing
            the developed image with a coating to stabilize it or putting it on a
            hard backing to prevent it from curling (American Chemical Society,
            n.d.).
        </p>
            
        <p>
            Howard G. Rogers, an inventor, and Director of Research with Edwin Land
            at Polaroid, invented the first instant color photograph process. The
            invention, Polacolor, was commercialized in 1963 and was acclaimed as
            the "most outstanding single advance in photographic science made
            during this century" (Flueckiger, 2012). His contributions led him to
            receive the Land Medal in 1993 for "significant inventions and ensuing
            development of synthetic sheet polarizers, plastic optical elements,
            instant color films, and birefringent polymers" (Optica, 2023). The
            film unit had a negative, a positive sheet, and a pod with fluid
            reagent. The negative layer had yellow, magenta, and cyan dye
            developers that were coated in separate layers beneath the blue, green,
            and red-sensitized silver halide emulsion layers (Flueckiger, 2012).
            The development was the same as Land's system, but the chemicals would
            keep reacting in the positive layer. The positive layers had to be
            transparent so light could penetrate through and expose the negative
            below. A polymeric acid layer underneath the image-receiving layer
            would stop all reactions by slowly diffusing its contents and reducing
            the pH of the image layer. This layer reacts with alkali and
            opacifiers in the reagent, making the opacifiers to become clear, which
            then makes the image visible. A timing layer slows the reagent down
            which gives the film time to develop before being exposed to light
            (Flueckiger, 2012). Polaroid's chemists tested thousands of new
            molecules to get proper color formation. 
        </p>
            
        <p>
            A problem that Polaroid encountered before Polacolor was released was
            the alkaline developers mixing with the other colored dyes into the
            positive layer causing the final image to be destroyed immediately.
            They solved this issue by adding acid molecules within a layer of
            polymer in the positive sheet to react with the alkaline molecules.
            This in turn formed water in the film and mixed the dyes in place
            (American Chemical Society, n.d.). Peeling the negative sheet to get
            the final image was still the same process.
        </p>

        <h2>The SX-70</h2>
    </header>

        <p>
            The SX-70 was Polaroid's crowning invention for the development of
            instant cameras. The SX-70 offered simplicity by pressing the shutter
            button and watching the film develop immediately (American Chemical
            Society, n.d.). This process took away the work of waiting sixty
            seconds before peeling off the negative sheet to get the final
            picture. The negative, positive, and developers were all contained
            within a film unit and would remain there after developing. The
            positive layers had to be transparent to allow light to penetrate
            through and expose the negative. By achieving this, a chemical screen
            that was clear when undeveloped but opaque, and would become clear
            again to reveal the developed image. In a two-millimeter-thick film, it
            had seventeen layers in total. It was commercialized in 1972 and was a
            representation of Land's 1943 "dream of absolute instant photography"
            (American Chemical Society, n.d.).

        <h2>The uses of the Instant Camera</h2>
    </header>

        <p>
            Instant cameras were mainly for personal and art use. The idea of
            capturing moments in time in an instant was why the instant camera
            became popular as soon as it was released. Many units were sold at
            departmnt stores on release day. There were times when it wouldn't get
            too much attention but always managed to be popular again. Instant
            cameras were used during crime scene investigations before digital
            cameras. Instant photography was used to document and collect crime
            scene evidence for examination and use in criminal court. It allowed
            law enforcement agencies to control their field costs and perform their
            duties at the highest level. The photographs would help re-create the
            story of the crime in court since they provided a clear visual record
            of the scene (Smith, 2003). Once digital photography was available,
            instant photography was of no use.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Polaroid's marketing strategy was to recruit artists to test its
            products and they would get free cameras, free film, and studio space
            to take photos of whatever they wanted as long as they shared it with
            the Collections Committee (Moore, 2022). Andy Warhol is an artist
            who is greatly known for carrying Polaroid cameras from 1957 to 1987
            to document himself and his friends (Speck, 2023). He took more than
            100,000 photographs that consisted of portraits of his friends and
            celebrities. Some of his exhibitions included his Mick Jagger series
            and Ladies and Gentlemen, which "captured Black and Latino trans and
            drag queens" (Speck, 2023). Warhol tested out many Polaroid cameras,
            but the SX-70 and the Big Shot were the main ones he used. He had said:
            <i>"I think anybody can take a good picture. My idea of a good
            picture is one that's in focus and of a famous person doing something
            infamous"</i> (Speck, 2023). After the influence it created, many
            artists started to use it, which led to it resurging in popularity
            again.

        <h2>Polaroid Bankruptcy</h2>
    </header>

        <p>
            After the SX-70, Polaroid attempted to make an instant camera called
            the Polavision. It would be an invention similar to a cassette player,
            but with film reels with the film being eight millimeters, and you
            could develop and view it at the same time. It used simple color
            additives of a three-color filter layer that instantly developed it.
            Unfortunately, it was a complete failure because it was too dark from
            the extremely slow film, couldn't record sound, and a certain device
            was required to watch the developed movie. It would only record up to
            at least two and a half minutes as well whereas videocassettes during
            that time could record up to an hour. It was released in 1977 but
            discontinued in 1979. Edwin Land was insistent on thinking it would be
            a success (Goulish, 2023). Despite his major successes with instant
            cameras and his company, Polaroid, Edwin Land resigned on July 27,
            1982. The Polavisions's failure caused a financial disaster for
            Polaroid, which ultimately led Land to step down from his position
            (The New York Times, 1982).

        <h2>The Rebirth of Polaroid</h2>
    </header>

        <p>
            The company kept declining after Land's resignation. After filing for
            bankruptcy twice in less than a decade along with failed revivals, a
            man named Florian Kaps was determined to bring Polaroid back. Kaps was
            a big fan of the company's analog instant film. In 2004, he had been
            selling them online and had built a community of 40,000 instant
            photography enthusiasts. When Polaroid announced that it would stop
            producing film in 2008, Kaps bought the last Polaroid film factory in
            the Netherlands. In 2012, he created his Kickstarter campaign for a
            camera that turns iPhone photos into instant Polaroid prints for a new
            generation of enthusiasts. He was passionate about reviving the
            company since he believed that "physical mementos become more resonant
            as digital media makes our memories less tangible" (Kickstarter, 2021).
            The factory had all of the machinery necessary, but no institutional
            knowledge, and so the project had to reinvent the process. The
            Polaroid corporation continued to decline, and The Impossible Project
            continued to make films for camera enthusiasts. In 2017, they were
            able to get what remained of Polaroid which was the brand and
            intellectual property. It was rebranded as Polaroid Originals and it
            still lives on to this day (Kickstarter, 2021). Kaps's love for
            Polaroid film revived the company and has had the biggest impact on
            the revival of film.

        <p>
            Instant film has stayed the same ever since the creation of the SX-70
            camera. Instant cameras have changed their exterior while keeping the
            interior the same. Newer instant cameras have developed to become like
            digital cameras. Manual control options, auto-exposure, and being able
            to see the full photo before deciding to print or retake the photo are
            some examples of features that instant cameras now have. An
            innovation Polaroid created in 2021 was the Polaroid Now Plus, which
            lets you manually adjust certain features through an app on mobile
            devices. Ever since the revival and re-popularity of instant cameras,
            it continues to maintain relevancy. Fujifilm and Polaroid are the main
            companies that are widely known for their instant cameras. Fujifilm's
            Instax series is a popular choice with younger audiences and Polaroid
            continues to create various types of instant film printing. With new
            models coming out every year or so, instant cameras will remain with us
            for a long time.
